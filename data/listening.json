While employees often report increased flexibility and improved work–life balance, employers remain divided on its long-term effectiveness. Some managers argue that reduced face-to-face interaction can weaken collaboration and company culture. Others, however, claim that productivity can actually improve when employees are given greater autonomy. As companies continue to experiment with hybrid models, the debate over the future of work shows no sign of being resolved.",
